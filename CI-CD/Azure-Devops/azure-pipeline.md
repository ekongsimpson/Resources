* A trigger tells a pipeline to run.
* A pipeline is made up of one or more stages. A pipeline can deploy to one or more environments.
* A stage is a way of organizing jobs in a pipeline and each stage can have one or more jobs.
* Each job runs on one agent. A job can also be agentless.
* Each agent runs a job that contains one or more steps.
* A step can be a task or script and is the smallest building block of a pipeline.
* A task is a prepackaged script that performs an action, such as invoking a REST API or publishing a build artifact.
* An artifact is a collection of files or packages published by a run.
