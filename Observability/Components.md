## The three pillars of observability."

Observability is achieved through a combination of **metrics**, **logs**, and **traces**


Metrics:

- Quantifiable measures of a system's performance.
- Examples: CPU usage, memory consumption, request rates, error rates, latency.
- Tools: Prometheus, Datadog, Azure Monitor, CloudWatch.

Logs:

- Detailed, time-stamped records of events that occur within a system.
- Help diagnose issues or analyze behavior.
- Tools: Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK), Fluentd, Azure Log Analytics, Splunk.

Traces:

- Detailed records of how requests or workflows propagate through a distributed system.
- Essential for debugging performance issues in microservices architectures.
- Tools: Jaeger, OpenTelemetry, AWS X-Ray, Azure Application Insights.
